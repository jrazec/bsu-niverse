# BSU-niverse!
What and Why??
Bsu-niverse is a 2D-role playing game which is kinda similar to pokemon. This game was initially created as our final project in our database management subject in our sophomore era âœ¨. Its first title was "The Campus Chronicles" which we've used C#.Net framework (mainly drag and drop), then improved it in our advanced dbms where we made into a web based system using Kaboom.js(as our frontend framework), Nodejs as our backend, and ejs for templating. Now, we thought of recreating it in our application development subject, where we will be or ig by the time you are reading this, "we used" Flame on top of Flutter as our stack. Possibly, we'll be utilizing MongoDB or any SQL outta here so u bettah watch out --tbc!
